Description of data in Appendix 2: First Flowering Data

This csv contains information on the photoperiod of various species from the literature.
Please contact karen.zeng@unsw.edu.au for more information.

Inclusion Rules:

- Populations are recorded as seperate records if the distance between them is <50km (<31 miles)

- If only place names are provided, coordinates will be found through google earth pro (version 7.3.3.7786 (64-bit))

Other reminders:

- Before use of dataset, please note that coordinates have not been negative trnsformed where they state S and W. If they state N or E, it means that the transformation has been already performed by the authors of the source or by data entry during coordinate location from google earth.

species

photoperiod = photoperiod sensitivity of the plant according to the source

source_located = T/F whether a wild/naturalised source is defined in the literature

source_name = description of source location in literature

lat = latitude

lon = longitude

Alpine/not = derived from source coordinates
Min Temp = derived from source coordinates

LAI = derived from species information on TRY or Kew
Seed mass = derived from species information on TRY or Kew

cultivar = any cultivars or common names that the plant is known under

reference = reference in which the photoperiod data was found in

notes = additional notes

sensitivity_yn = a binary variable of whether the record is of a photoperiod sensitivity requirement in general

simple_photoperiodism = a simplified version of the photoperiod variable

order = order in which photoperiod sensitivity was decided if there were discrepancies (1 = more likely to reflect species).

order = the order in which the record was considered if there were different photoperiod requirements reported in the literature. (1 = priority source, 2 = non-priority source, 3 = duplicate species record due to multiple populations sampled)
