# Trends-in-Germination-Photoperiod

This repository is for the analyses performed in the manuscript Jagdish et al. (In Review) - Shining a light on patterns of photoperiod sensitivty in seed germination across latitudes, ecosystems and functional traits

There are four rmarkdown files:

- see Rmarkdown "BayesianPhotoperiodMetricOfficial.Rmd" for gaining a photoperiod sensitivity index for each species using bayesian GLMs
- see Rmarkdown file "PhylogeneticAnalysis.Rmd" for Phylogenetic Analyses of photoperiod sensitivity across our species
- see Rmarkdown file "MainAnalyses.Rmd" for main analysis of germination photoperiod sensitivity and it's relationship with all environmental/ecological predictor variables
- see Rmarkdown file "Analysis of flowering photoperiod.Rmd" for a repeated analysis of the photoperiod relationships that were performed on germination of species repeated on flowering time (this code is very similar to "MainAnalyses.Rmd")
