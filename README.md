# Trends-in-Germination-Photoperiod

This repository is for the analyses performed in the manuscript Perrin, Moles, Offord, Slavich and Everingham (In Review) - SShining a light on patterns of photoperiod sensitivity in germination and flowering across latitudes, ecosystems and functional traits

There are four Rmarkdown files:

- see Rmarkdown "BayesianPhotoperiodMetricOfficial.Rmd" for gaining a photoperiod sensitivity index for each species using bayesian GLMs
- see Rmarkdown file "PhylogeneticAnalysis.Rmd" for Phylogenetic Analyses of photoperiod sensitivity across our species
- see Rmarkdown file "MainAnalyses.Rmd" for main analysis of germination photoperiod sensitivity and it's relationship with all environmental/ecological predictor variables
- se Rmarkdown file "Dataset_Processing_flowering_photoperiod.Rmd" for cleaning flowering photoperiod data to use for further analyses on global flowering photoperiod sensitivity analysis
- see Rmarkdown file "Analysis of flowering photoperiod.Rmd" for a repeated analysis of the photoperiod relationships that were performed on germination of species repeated on flowering time (this code is very similar to "MainAnalyses.Rmd")

All data for analyses is avaialble in the data folder
